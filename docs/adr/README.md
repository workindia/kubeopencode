# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains **active** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the KubeOpenCode project.
ADRs document significant architectural and design decisions along with their context and consequences.

> **For AI agents**: Only ADRs in this directory are relevant for current development.
> The `archived/` subdirectory contains superseded, fully-implemented, and research-only ADRs
> that are kept for historical reference but should NOT be loaded into context unless explicitly needed.

## Archived ADRs

Archived ADRs are in [`archived/`](archived/). They include:

- **Superseded**: Decisions replaced by newer ADRs (0002, 0011, 0013, 0015, 0017, 0023)
- **Fully Implemented**: Decisions fully absorbed into code and AGENTS.md (0001, 0006-0010, 0014, 0018-0019, 0021-0022, 0024-0028, 0033, 0037-0038)
- **Research/Informational**: Analysis documents with no code impact (0032, 0039)

### Archive Policy

An ADR is archived when:
1. It is **superseded** by a newer ADR
2. It is **fully implemented** and its key decisions are summarized in `AGENTS.md`
3. It is a **research/informational** document with no actionable code changes

Archived ADRs are never deleted — they remain available for historical context.
When a new feature fully implements an Accepted ADR, move it to `archived/` and ensure
the key decisions are captured in `AGENTS.md`.
